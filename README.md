# BulletimBoard
I had an assignement to build a bulletim board for one of my classes. I literally took it to a whole other level.
This was made with very simple (non practical) C++, HTML, and AJAX.
In this repository the only files shown are the c++ scripts that handle different features of the board and the HTML file with all the AJAX.
The data gets encrypted and decrypted (I build a very rustic decoding scheme) from textfiles. The ajax protocol file is not shown here.

It was a great way to train the computer thinking scheme and learn the logic behind C++.

The working version of the little project can be found here:
