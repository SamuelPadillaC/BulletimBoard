# BulletimBoard
Started as an assignement to build a bulletim board for one of my classes. I took it to a whole other level.

Built with C++, HTML, and AJAX.
In this repository the only files shown are the c++ scripts that handle different features of the board and the HTML file with all the AJAX.

The data gets encrypted and decrypted (I build my own decoding scheme) from textfiles. The ajax protocol file is not shown here.

The working version of the little project can be found here:
